the cloning stuff as usual and then README.md reads:

This time your task is to push a file to the remote repository.

Details:
    File name: key.txt
    Content: 'May I come in?'
    Branch: master

you create a file with these credentials and then do the git adding to stage stuff, commiting and lastly pushing:

git add key.txt -f

git commit -m "placeholderMessage"

git push origin master
