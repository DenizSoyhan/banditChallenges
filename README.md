My not so great solutions to the [Over the Wire Bandit Challenges](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/)

The directory names tells that "in order enter that specific bandit user you need to do these". So "level14" contains what you should do in bandit13 user and also the password of the bandit14. They change the passwords regularly and these puzzles were done in early September of 2024

There is an executable file in the **"reviewerScript"** directory. It visualizes the ratings that I gave it to the individual levels. There are reviews and little hints for the levels also but they are in Turkish so it might not help much.
